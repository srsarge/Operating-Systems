One Operating System Functions
Most operating systems perform some of the same functions like powering on a computer or mobile device, using an UI, manage programs, memory and monitor performance. 
An example of one of these functions is the command-Line. 
"The user can type commands using short keywords or abbreciations to enter data and instructions."

Another Operating system function is configuring devices. The driver is a "small program that tells the operating system how to communcate with specific device." Keyboards, mice, webcame, streaming microphone has it's own commands which requires a specific driver. I've had to download software from my computer's website that way I could customize my keyboard and mouse buttons.

Monitoring Performance is a program that "assets and reports information about various computer resources and devices." When running the program you can see the proccessors, drives, networks, and memory usage

"a small piece of software, is loaded from the volume boot code that is a part of the volume boot record. It enables you to boot Windows 10/8/7 or Windows Vista operating system."
