One Operating System Functions
Most operating systems perform some of the same functions like powering on a computer or mobile device, using an UI, manage programs, memory and monitor performance. 
An example of one of these functions is the command-Line. 
"The user can type commands using short keywords or abbreciations to enter data and instructions."

Another Operating system function is configuring devices. The driver is a "small program that tells the operating system how to communcate with specific device." Keyboards, mice, webcame, streaming microphone has it's own commands which requires a specific driver. I've had to download software from my computer's website that way I could customize my keyboard and mouse buttons.

Monitoring Performance is a program that "assets and reports information about various computer resources and devices." When running the program you can see the proccessors, drives, networks, and memory usage
